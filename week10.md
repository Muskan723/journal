Learning Activities & Resources
This week, my team and I conducted a stand-up meeting followed by a group rehearsal for our upcoming presentation. We focused on preparing our slide deck, practicing delivery, and refining our demonstration. To ensure a smooth presentation, we also completed a technical check of the equipment and environment.

The rehearsal involved running through our presentation three times. After each run, we reviewed our performance using the rubric provided in the assignment document. Feedback from these sessions helped us identify gaps in content, timing, and overall delivery, which we worked to address before the next rehearsal.

To further improve, I practiced on my own, recorded my parts of the presentation, and reviewed the recordings to refine my speaking pace and clarity.

Estimated Hours
I spent about 2 hours rehearsing with the group and another 1 hours refining my individual part of the presentation. Additional time was dedicated to coordinating and preparing the technical setup.

Content Insights
This rehearsal process highlighted several areas for improvement:

Timing: Our first run exceeded the allotted time. Adjusting transitions and streamlining some sections brought us within the required timeframe.
Engagement: We identified opportunities to make our delivery more interactive and relatable, such as adding audience-focused examples to our explanations.
Visuals and Demonstration: Some slides were cluttered with text. We simplified these to emphasize key points and added visuals to support our explanations. Additionally, we practiced demonstrating our project effectively, ensuring that it was realistic and easy to follow.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The process reinforced the importance of preparation, feedback, and iteration in developing strong presentation skills. Practicing multiple times with peer feedback helped improve my confidence and adaptability.

I also realized the value of technical checks—testing microphones, lighting, and camera setups early on saved us from potential issues during the actual presentation. Recording our rehearsal was especially helpful for spotting areas where body language, tone, or clarity needed improvement.

This experience has strengthened my ability to present in professional and collaborative settings. It’s a skill I know will be valuable in my career, where clear communication and engaging presentations can make a significant impact.
