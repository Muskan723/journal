Learning Activities & Resources
In this practical, I wrote and ran PHP scripts to demonstrate several key concepts. My tasks included creating scripts that used:

1. Echo statements to display HTML dynamically.
2. If/else statements to add decision-making logic.
3. Loops (for, while, foreach) for handling arrays and repetitive tasks.
4. Functions with parameters to modularize and reuse code.
5. Include statements to create a shared header and footer across multiple pages.

To complete this, I referred to the following resources:
PHP Manual – For syntax and functions.
W3Schools PHP Tutorials – For beginner-friendly examples and explanations.
Course materials, including the Advice Shop template, which I customized with added features like a simple login page.

Estimated Hours:
I dedicated about 10 hours to this task, including coding, debugging, and testing the PHP scripts.

Content Insights
Through this practical, I gained a deeper understanding of server-side programming. 

Key insights include:
Dynamic Content Creation: Using echo and loops to generate HTML dynamically based on user inputs or data from arrays.
Reusable Components: The include function simplifies code maintenance by centralizing common elements like headers and footers.
Error Handling: Debugging errors in PHP was a valuable learning experience, teaching me to troubleshoot effectively

I also explored how PHP interacts with HTML and CSS, which gave me a holistic view of full-stack development.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Although I am planning a career as a back-end developer, learning PHP has expanded my skill set, making me more versatile as a developer. It gave me insights into how dynamic web applications are created, which is a critical skill in modern web development.

Moreover, writing reusable functions and managing arrays are skills that translate well into other programming languages, making this experience valuable even outside PHP. This practical also helped me develop problem-solving skills by debugging and optimizing my code, which is an essential skill in any tech-related career.
