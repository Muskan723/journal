Learning Activities & Resources
This week I focused on creating a small flower shop website using HTML, SCSS, and CSS, and I explored the various Sass features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. To set up my workflow, I also used Sass compilation tools and manual SCSS compilation to output a clean CSS file. Additionally, I looked into using color schemes and more advanced CSS properties to improve the visual appeal of the website.

I followed a few resources to enhance my understanding of the workflow:

Sass Documentation: https://sass-lang.com/
LinkedIn Learning Course: Sass Essentials
Article on SCSS Best Practices: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/advanced-sass-techniques/

Estimated Hours: 
I spent approximately 5 hours this week on this subject, including setup, coding, and troubleshooting the Sass compilation process.

Content Insights
During the course of this project, I gained insights into the capabilities of Sass in web development and its effective implementation. I delved into several fundamental concepts, including:

Variables: I established values for colors, fonts, and other reusable elements to ensure uniformity throughout the website. For instance, I defined $primary-color: #ff6f61; as the primary color theme.

Nesting: This feature enabled me to organize the CSS in a structured and comprehensible manner, allowing related styles to be grouped together (for example, nesting styles for .header and .nav within the header block).

Mixins: I employed mixins to create reusable segments of CSS for button styles, which facilitated the application of a consistent design with varying properties (such as border-radius).

Extend/Inheritance: By utilizing the @extend directive, I was able to formulate shared styles for buttons and cards, thereby minimizing redundancy and ensuring consistent application of these styles.

Through my experience with Sass, I discovered that the development process was significantly more efficient compared to writing CSS directly, particularly when managing a large project or requiring swift modifications.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This project has enhanced my comprehension of managing and organizing stylesheets for web development through the use of Sass.

Additionally, I gained a deeper appreciation for the significance of a well-structured design and the pivotal role CSS plays in developing user-friendly interfaces. By applying color theory to a project such as a flower shop website, I recognized the critical importance of visual aesthetics in fostering user engagement.

From a career perspective, I now possess greater confidence in executing web development tasks, especially those that involve CSS pre-processors like Sass. This project has provided me with valuable insights into front-end web design and workflow optimization, which will prove advantageous in future professional settings where I am tasked with creating responsive and visually appealing websites.
