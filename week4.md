Week 4 

Learning Activities and Resources:
This week, we explored the conditions for our final assignment, which involves creating two websites using different CMS platforms Joomla and WordPress. A major part of the discussion revolved around the deployment process and the significance of having structured deployment surroundings. We studied the three key stages of deployment: 
•	Local Environment: The initial phase where development is done on a particular machine, allowing for trial and initial testing. 
•	Staging Environment: A pre-production setup where the website is tested in a controlled environment that mirrors the live version, ensuring any issues can be addressed before going live. 
•	Production Environment: The live platform where the final website is made intimately available for users. 

These stages are essential for maintaining a smooth workflow and ensuring high- quality website development. 

Resourses Used:
•	Joomla Documentation 
•	WordPress Documentation 
•	Deployment Stages Overview 
•	Video on Deployment Practices 

Estimated Hours:
I spent around 8 hours this week: 4 hours on class discussions and 4 hours exploring Joomla and WordPress as I began working on Assignment 1. 

Content Insights:
This week provided me with a deeper understanding of the deployment process and its role in creating reliable workflows for website development. Learning to separate work across local, staging, and production environments has been eye-opening, helping me visualize how professional projects are managed. Starting the assignment also introduced me to the setup processes in Joomla and WordPress, giving me hands on experience with these CMS platforms. 

 Career/ Employability/ Learning Insights:
 By understanding deployment workflows, I'm developing a skill set that aligns with professional web development practices. This knowledge will help me manage systems more efficiently and minimize risks during deployment. Additionally, working with Joomla and WordPress has broadened my familiarity with CMS platforms, which is a valuable asset for any web inventor looking to increase their Adaptability and marketability in the industry.
