Week 2 – Joomla

Learning Activities and Resources
This week, I concentrated on learning Joomla to make the foundational structure for my flower shop website. I started by setting up Joomla, familiarizing myself with its admin interface, and exploring its core features, including content operation, template customization, and module placement. I spent time understanding how Joomla handles templates, papers, and extensions. The thing was to ensure that my flower shop website had a clean, stoner-friendly layout with all the necessary functionalities. Some of the key resources I used were: 
•	Joomla Beginner’s Guide 
•	YouTube videotape Joomla 4 Tutorial for newcomers How to make a Website with Joomla(https://youtu.be/h5VZwTLdgdM?si=1SomwCMMaHsPyXt3) 
•	Joomla Extension Directory for chancing useful tools and plugins.    

Estimated Hours 
I spent about 6 hours learning Joomla’s content operating system and customizing templates for my flower shop.   

Content Insights
This week gave me a solid to Joomla’s flexible content operating system. Joomla operates differently from other CMS platforms like WordPress because of its further structured, modular approach. One of the first effects I learned was how Joomla organizes content into papers and how these papers are distributed to maintain a logical flow on the website. This will be particularly useful when organizing product descriptions, orders of flowers, and promotional papers for my flower shop website.   
I also explored Joomla's template system. I worked with some pre-built templates but also learned how to make adaptations through the Template Manager and discovered the power of Joomla's module system. Modules allowed me to display specific content — similar to flower orders, contact forms, and promotional banners — anywhere on the runner. This inflexibility will be helpful as I further develop my website’s layout to insure an intuitive shopping experience for callers.   
One challenge I faced was situating modules rightly on the point, but after pertaining to Joomla’s attestation, I got the hang of module positions and how they interact with the overall layout.   

Career/ Employability/ Learning Insights 
Learning Joomla has been a precious experience because it offers inflexibility and structure that can be applied to a variety of complex systems. Although WordPress is more popular for lower, less complex spots, Joomla’s versatility is beneficial for projects that require more detailed content management or custom layouts. This week gave me a better understanding of how to work with Joomla's templates and module system, skills that can come in handy if I decide to take on more technical web development roles in the future.   
Also, working with Joomla made me more confident in handling multiple CMS platforms, which are a great asset for employability. Many clients may prefer Joomla to WordPress for certain projects, and having this experience will allow me to offer a wider range of services to potential employers or clients. The capability to customize templates and use modules will also be useful for any e-commerce.   sites I build, making me more versatile as a web developer.
