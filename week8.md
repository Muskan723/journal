Estimated Hours Spent:
I spent approximately 7 hours on this topic, including reading documentation, following tutorials, and building my custom navigation menu.

Content Insights
Learning to create a custom navigation menu was a significant step in understanding WordPress theme functionality. Navigation menus are a crucial part of any website, and learning how to customize them allowed me to adapt WordPress to meet specific design and usability requirements.

Key takeaways:

Registering Menus:

*Menus are registered in the functions.php file using the register_nav_menus() function.

*Displaying Menus in Themes:
Menus are added to theme files using wp_nav_menu().
I created a custom header.php template that included a dynamic menu:

*Styling Navigation:
Custom CSS was used to ensure the menu matched the theme’s design. I learned about advanced CSS selectors to style dropdowns and add hover effects.

*Improving Usability:
I included an accessible toggle button for mobile users, leveraging JavaScript to enhance the menu’s functionality on smaller screens.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From a career perspective, creating custom navigation menus is a fundamental skill for WordPress developers. Employers often look for developers who can build responsive, accessible, and user-friendly navigation systems.

Learning insights:

Problem-Solving with Documentation: This project taught me to rely on official WordPress documentation for solutions, which is a critical skill for professional development.
Building for Accessibility: Adding ARIA roles and attributes to my menu improved its usability for screen readers, a feature that is becoming increasingly important in web development.
Iterative Learning: My approach—following a tutorial, implementing the code, and then refining it based on design needs—allowed me to understand not just how to build a menu, but why certain practices are essential.

Final Reflection
This week, I gained a deeper understanding of how WordPress manages navigation menus and how to customize them to meet specific requirements. The combination of PHP, CSS, and JavaScript in this project reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary skills in web development. I now feel more confident in my ability to create functional and visually appealing menus for any WordPress theme.
